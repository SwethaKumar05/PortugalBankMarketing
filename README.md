# PortugalBankMarketing
This project explores the effectiveness of bank marketing strategies in Portugal using logistic regression and AdaBoost algorithms. Through comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection techniques, and the application of logistic regression and AdaBoost models, we aim to understand the key factors influencing the success of marketing campaigns in the banking sector. The project includes the implementation of confusion matrices to evaluate model performance and provide insights into predictive accuracy.
